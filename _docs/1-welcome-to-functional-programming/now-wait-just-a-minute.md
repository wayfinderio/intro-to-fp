Let's recap the past few sections.

- Values are data that never changes
- We can declare variables and bind values to them
- These bindings never change unless we use `let`, and that should be very rarely needed
- Functions **always** take at least one argument and **always** produce a value

So as a community, we started with

![Javascript The Definitive Guide](/images/js_definitive_guide.jpg){:width="300px"}

_1096 pages_

And then later when JavaScript started to blow up and be used for rich applications, we got

![Javascript The Definitive Guide](/images/js_good_parts.jpg){:width="300px"}

_176 pages_

Now this stuff you're describing is

![Javascript The FP Guide](/images/js_fp_guide.png){:width="300px"}

_5 pages_

You can't be serious.

#### What is the point of this?

We've talked a bit about what a functional version of JavaScript looks like, but we haven't talked about why it might be this way. Seeing the differences may have brought up a lot of questions, this may even feel dumb or limiting. In the next section we'll dive into the motivation behind these decisions.
