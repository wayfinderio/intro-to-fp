Familiarity with JavaScript is a pre-requisite for this course. In order to evaluate your preparedness for the kinds of things we'll be doing, there are several problems provided here. **Feel free to skip this section.** If you can complete all of these exercises you are prepared to start the course.

# Exercises

For each of these exercises you can use an online site such as [JS Bin](jsbin.com) or [JS Fiddle](jsfiddle.net) or you can copy them to a local file and run them with Node.
