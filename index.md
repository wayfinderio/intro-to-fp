Welcome to this course. It is our sincerest hope that you will find the topic of functional programming as rich and rewarding as we have. Functional programming delivers on the decades long quest to find a fundamentally better way of constructing software that is both reliable and easily modified. This may sound too good to be true, and certainly there have been many such claims. I urge you go judge for yourself what functional programming has to offer by way of its construction, the core principles on which it is based. Our tools shape the expression of our solutions and as a result, we must be conscious of what tradeoffs our tools impose. It is common to seek out the most powerful solution to a problem, what could possibly be the downside of more power?  As you will see, it's often the drawbacks of our tools that cause us long term problems, drawbacks that are often not even acknowledged as existing much less addressed.
